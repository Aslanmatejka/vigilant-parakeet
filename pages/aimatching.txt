Integrate Deepseek LLM into my existing barter and resource economy app to power an AI Matching Engine. Use the Deepseek API (key: sk-c28f285a0947483dacd0c0850dfg0) to implement intelligent, context-aware matching logic based on the following core criteria.

üß† Use Case: AI Matching Engine
‚ÄúThe intelligent heart of the barter and resource economy.‚Äù

‚úÖ Core Features to Implement
1. Location Matching

Goal: Prioritize local matches to reduce effort/time.

Logic:

Input: User‚Äôs GPS or LoRa signal data.

Match based on:

Distance (<5km preferred)

Area type (urban, rural, off-grid, disaster)

LoRa mesh reachability (if offline)

AI Actions:

Sort results by proximity

Flag unreachable listings

Suggest LoRa relay points

2. Urgency Matching

Goal: Prioritize needs based on urgency.

Logic:

Input: ‚ÄúNeed by‚Äù timestamps

Classify urgency:

Critical > High > Normal > Optional

AI Actions:

Prioritize time-sensitive offers

Trigger alerts for unmet urgent needs

Allow value override in survival cases

3. Value Similarity Matching

Goal: Ensure fair trades without money.

Logic:

Input: Value tags (time, effort, rarity)

Value estimation from:

Manual input

Community feedback

AI-calculated: scarcity, effort, popularity

AI Actions:

Create value equivalency maps

Flag unfair trades or potential exploitation

4. Trust-Based Matching

Goal: Promote reliable, safe interactions.

Logic:

Input: Trade history, reviews, local endorsements

Trust metrics:

Star ratings, feedback tags, flags

Verified users (elders, pastors, etc.)

AI Actions:

Rank trusted users higher

Recommend badges/rewards

Avoid unreliable users in urgent trades

5. Match Type Intelligence

Like-for-Like Matching:

Direct matches (e.g., rice for rice)

AI prioritizes high trust + fast resolution

Complementary / Multi-party Matching:

Circular or triangular swaps (e.g., carpentry ‚áÑ honey ‚áÑ firewood)

AI suggests 3+ party loops, with shared ledger logic

üîÑ Matching Algorithm Flow (Define in Code)
Scan: Check all offers/needs

Filter: Eliminate low-trust, far-away, or urgency-mismatched items

Score: Use weights for:

Location (0‚Äì10)

Urgency (0‚Äì10)

Value (0‚Äì10)

Trust (0‚Äì10)

Simplicity (Direct = 10, Loop = 5)

Sort & Suggest: Show top matches with tags like:

‚ö° Urgent Match

ü§ù Fair Trade

‚ôªÔ∏è Loop Trade

Learn: Track trade outcomes (success, timing, satisfaction), feed results to refine future recommendations
